# Experiment Investigation

## Status

The prior experiment cannot support a conclusion that joint learning does or does not improve forecasting. Its core implementation defects have been corrected in this revision, but the experiment must be rerun with fresh data and repeated evaluation before comparing methods.

## Fixes Applied

- The decoder now retains the most recent seed window, allowing predicted or teacher-forced rates and future exogenous features to reach later forecast steps.
- Continued validation reuse has been removed. The default is now to test the validation-selected checkpoint directly.
- Zero filling is causal, global features are scaled per group from training observations only, and local SIRD scaling and clustering use the training split only.
- OneCycleLR now advances for each successful optimizer update and resets after its configured total step count.
- Shared/private freezing uses the correct model instances and branch-specific modules; source loss is normalized so `source_weight` is the combined contribution of all sources.
- Cluster alignment now rejects sources without sufficient history before the target training split.
- CUDA conversion, Friedman statistics, ARIMA-SIRD metric scaling, SIRD forecast timing, and multi-step cumulative reconstruction have been corrected.

## Required Rerun Design

- Add a decoder regression test verifying that each generated output replaces the oldest seed entry.
- Add regression tests for preprocessing boundaries, scheduler steps, freezing, GPU evaluation, and baseline metrics.
- Select hyperparameters and epochs on validation data once. If refitting on train plus validation, use the selected fixed epoch count without validation monitoring.
- Normalize source loss so all sources together have a configurable total weight, then test no-source and target-specific source-selection ablations.
- Compare private-only, hard-shared, joint, pooled, and naive baselines with equal search budgets over multiple seeds and rolling forecast origins.
- Verify corrected GPU evaluation, baselines, and statistical testing in the rerun before publishing comparisons.
